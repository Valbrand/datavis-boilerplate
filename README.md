A boilerplate project for the Data Visualization course in UFPE's CIn (Center of Informatics).

This project uses [`sass`](http://sass-lang.com), [`webpack`](http://webpack.github.io), [`eslint`](http://eslint.org) and allows for the use of [`React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/). [`D3`](https://d3js.org) is available as an installed package after the initial setup.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need to have `npm` available on your computer. Therefore, you must install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Getting started

Getting ready to go is as easy as cloning/downloading this repo and running `npm install`. To build the bundled Javascript file, you can run the command `npm run build`, and  the command `npm run serve` can be used to test your page properly. To run the code analysis routine with `eslint`, use the command `npm run lint`.
